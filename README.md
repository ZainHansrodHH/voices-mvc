# Voices MVC
Voices MVC Application

I've added a live version of this at this URL - https://www.zainhansrod.com/voices

This application contains a simple form which allows the user to enter in details for a voices project 

The app then sends an email containing the data for the form as well as a migration script that could be used for a live version.
